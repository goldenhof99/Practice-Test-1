            <h2> Over Design Controls </h2>
            <p> Old fashioned typesetting were greatly limited on their physical tools and required heavily on the print process. While HTML and CSS can provide live edits and can go back and change mistakes far easier. </p>

            <h2> Visuals </h2>
            <p> The limited resources of the old fashioned caused for perhaps a lack of outstanding visual creativity, while HTML and CSS can create modern visuals as scene on webpages and docuemnts like the one you are reading.</p>
