        <h1> Key Differences: Google Docs vs HTML Document</h1>
        <h3> User Difficulty Experience </h3>
        <p> Google Docs are far less complex and require far fewer steps with similar goals in mind (to get text on page). On the contrary the HTML document will require far more time, thus leading to a higher degree of difficulty.</p>
        <h3> Finsihed Document</h3>
        <p> When dealing with Google Docs whenever submitting a final document, Google Docs will typically finish in either a PDF or Word document. HTML on the contrary usually ends in a finsihed, designed web page.</p>
        <h3> Multi-User Functionality</h3>
        <p> Google docs allows for a live multi user experience, while HTML however offers a single user experience where its users cannot band together.</p>
